<h1>Re: Albert Momo University Application</h1>
<hr />
<p>Dear Mr. Momo</p>
<p>Thank you for recent application to join st Starz University's science family to study as part of your phD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
<h2>Starting dates</h2>
<p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time,however it would suit us better if you could start at the begining of a semester, the start dates for each one are as follow:</p>
<p>First semester, 9 october 2022<br>Second semester, 15 January 2023<br>Third semester, 2 May 2023</p>
<p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date would you prefer.</p>
<p>You can find more imformation about important university dates on our website.</p>
<h2>Subjects of Study</h2>
<p>At the Starz University,we have a pretty open-minded rescearh facility_as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seems like an intelligent dedicated reseacher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team, saying that , of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
    <p>Turning H<sub>2</sub>0 into wine, and the health benefit of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)
    <p>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores</p>
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctrate work,I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favorite dances are as follows, definition:</p>
    <p><dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt></p>
    <p><dd>A litlle known but very influtial dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dances around in acircle like chickens, to encourage their live stocks to be "fruitful".</dd></p>
    <p><dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt></p>
    <p><dd>Before the icelanders develop fire as a means of getting warm, they used to pratice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students use to say that he taught this dance inspired modern style such as Twerking </dd></p>
    <p><dt>Aretic robot dance</dt></p>
    <p><dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in 1960s belived to have discover new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements,being pratice by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd></p>

    <p><dt>Yours sincerely</dt></p>
